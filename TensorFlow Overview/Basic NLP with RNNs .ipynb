A common example of NLP is something like spellcheck or autocomplete. Essentially NLP is the field that focuses on how computers can understand and/or process natural/human languages. \n","\n","###Recurrent Neural Networks\n","\n","In this tutorial we will introduce a new kind of neural network that is much more capable of processing sequential data such as text or characters called a **recurrent neural network** (RNN for short). \n","\n","We will learn how to use a reccurent neural network to do the following:\n","- Sentiment Analysis\n","- Character Generation \n","\n","RNN's are complex and come in many different forms so in this tutorial we wil focus on how they work and the kind of problems they are best suited for.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ur_FQq-Q-fxC"},"source":["## Sequence Data\n","In the previous tutorials we focused on data that we could represent as one static data point where the notion of time or step was irrelevant. Take for example our image data, it was simply a tensor of shape (width, height, channels). That data doesn't change or care about the notion of time. \n","\n","In this tutorial we will look at sequences of text and learn how we can encode them in a meaningful way. Unlike images, sequence data such as long chains of text, weather patterns, videos and really anything where the notion of a step or time is relevant needs to be processed and handled in a special way. \n","\n","But what do I mean by sequences and why is text data a sequence? Well that's a good question. Since textual data contains many words that follow in a very specific and meaningful order, we need to be able to keep track of each word and when it occurs in the data. Simply encoding say an entire paragraph of text into one data point wouldn't give us a very meaningful picture of the data and would be very difficult to do anything with. This is why we treat text as a sequence and process one word at a time. We will keep track of where each of these words appear and use that information to try to understand the meaning of peices of text.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8gQHK4V4e2wl"},"source":["##Encoding Text\n","As we know machine learning models and neural networks don't take raw text data as an input.

There are many different ways of doing this and we will look at a few examples below. \n","\n","Before we get into the different encoding/preprocessing methods let's understand the information we can get from textual data by looking at the following two movie reviews.\n","\n","```I thought the movie was going to be bad, but it was actually amazing!```\n","\n","```I thought the movie was going to be amazing, but it was actually bad!```\n","\n","Although these two setences are very similar we know that they have very different meanings.

For example, the words happy and joyful should probably have very similar labels so we can determine that they are similar. While words like horrible and amazing should probably have very different labels. The method we looked at above won't be able to do something like this for us.

You can add what's called an *embedding layer* to the beggining of your model and while your model trains your embedding layer will learn the correct embeddings for words.

Up until this point we have been using something called **feed-forward** neural networks. This simply means that all our data is fed forwards (all at once) from left to right through the network. This was fine for the problems we considered before but won't work very well for processing text. After all, even we (humans) don't process text all at once. We read word by word from left to right and keep track of the current meaning of the sentence so we can understand the meaning of the next word. Well this is exaclty what a recurrent neural network is designed to do. When we say recurrent neural network all we really mean is a network that contains a loop. A RNN will process one word at a time while maintaining an internal memory of what it's already seen. This will allow it to treat words differently based on their order in a sentence and to slowly build an understanding of the entire input, one word at a time.\n","\n","This is why we are treating our text data as a sequence!

The one we will talk about here is called LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). This layer works very similarily to the simpleRNN layer but adds a way to access inputs from any timestep in the past. Whereas in our simple RNN layer input from previous timestamps gradually disappeared as we got further through the input. With a LSTM we have a long-term memory data structure storing all the previously seen inputs as well as when we saw them. This allows for us to access any previous value we want at any point in time. This adds to the complexity of our network and allows it to discover more useful relationships between inputs and when they appear. \n","\n","For the purpose of this course we will refrain from going any further into the math or details behind how these layers work.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CRGOx6_v4eZ_"},"source":["##Sentiment Analysis\n","And now time to see a recurrent neural network in action.
